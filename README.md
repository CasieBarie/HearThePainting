# Hear The Painting
For my study, I described a painting using senses other than sight, specifically through sound.
I envisioned a scenario where blind individuals visiting a museum could touch the painting and hear accompanying sounds. I created a small webpage to illustrate this concept 
(It is in dutch and it doesnt work on small screens). You can view it over [here](https://casiebarie.github.io/HearThePainting/).
